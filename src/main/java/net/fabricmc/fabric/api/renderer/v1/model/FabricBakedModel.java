	 * This method will be called during chunk rebuilds to generate both the static and

	 *
	 * <p>During chunk rebuild, this method will always be called exactly one time per block
	 * position, irrespective of which or how many faces or block render layers are included
	 * in the model. Models must output all quads in a single pass.
	 *
	 * <p>Also called to render block models outside of chunk rebuild or block entity rendering.
	 * Typically, this happens when the block is being rendered as an entity, not as a block placed in the world.
	 * Currently, this happens for falling blocks and blocks being pushed by a piston, but renderers
	 * should invoke this for all calls to
	 * {@link ModelBlockRenderer#render(BlockAndTintGetter, BakedModel, BlockState, BlockPos, PoseStack, VertexConsumer, boolean, Random, long, int)}
	 * that occur outside of chunk rebuilds to allow for features added by mods, unless {@link #isVanillaAdapter()}
	 * returns true.
	 *
	 * <p>Outside of chunk rebuilds, this method will be called every frame. Model implementations should
	 * rely on pre-baked meshes as much as possible and keep transformation to a minimum.  The provided
	 * block position may be the <em>nearest</em> block position and not actual. For this reason, neighbor
	 * state lookups are best avoided or will require special handling. Block entity lookups are
	 * likely to fail and/or give meaningless results.
	 *
	 * <p>Note: with {@link BakedModel#getQuads(BlockState, Direction, Random)}, the random
	 * parameter is normally initialized with the same seed prior to each face layer.
	 * Model authors should note this method is called only once per block, and call the provided
	 * Random supplier multiple times if re-seeding is necessary.
	 *
	 * @param emitter Accepts model output.
	 * @param blockView Access to world state.
	 * @param state Block state for model being rendered.
	 * @param pos Position of block for model being rendered.
	 * @param randomSupplier Random object seeded per vanilla conventions. Call multiple times to re-seed.
	 *                       Will not be thread-safe. Do not cache or retain a reference.
	 * @param cullTest A test that returns {@code true} for faces which will be culled and {@code false} for faces which
	 *                 may or may not be culled. Meant to be used to cull groups of quads or expensive dynamic quads
	 *                 early for performance. Early culled quads will likely not be added the emitter, so callers of
	 *                 this method must account for this. In general, prefer using
	 *                 {@link MutableQuadView#cullFace(Direction)} instead of this test.

	 * should not be captured directly), and construct a new {@link BakedModel} which then uses
